<h1>Installing the Desktop Synchronization Client</h1>
<p>You can download the  latest version of the VaultDrop Desktop Synchronization
Client from the <a class="reference external" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/vaultdrop-client/download.html">VaultDrop download page</a>.
There are clients for Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>Installation on Mac OS X and Windows is the same as for any software
application: download the program and then double-click it to launch the
installation, and then follow the installation wizard. After it is installed and
configured the sync client will automatically keep itself updated.</p>

<div class="section" id="installation-wizard">
<h2>Installation Wizard</h2>
<p>The installation wizard takes you step-by-step through configuration options and
account setup. On the first screen it will initiate the login process in the browser.</p>
<img alt="form for entering VaultDrop server URL" src="./VaultDropClientDocs_files/client-1.png">
<p>Enter your VaultDrop login on the next screen.</p>
<img alt="form for entering your VaultDrop login" src="./VaultDropClientDocs_files/client-weblogin.png">
<p>On the Local Folder Option screen you may sync
all of your files on the VaultDrop server, or select individual folders. The
default local sync folder is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">VaultDrop</span></code>, in your home directory. You may
change this as well.</p>
<img alt="Select which remote folders to sync, and which local folder to store them in." src="./VaultDropClientDocs_files/client-3.png">
<p>When you have completed selecting your sync folders, click the Connect button
at the bottom right. The client will attempt to connect to your VaultDrop
server, and when it is successful you’ll see two buttons: one to connect to
your VaultDrop Web GUI, and one to open your local folder. It will also start
synchronizing your files.</p>
</div>
</div>



  <div class="section" id="using-the-synchronization-client">
<h1>Using the Synchronization Client</h1>
<p id="index-0">The VaultDrop Desktop Client remains in the background and is visible as an icon
in the system tray (Windows, KDE) or status bar (Mac OS X).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Status icon, icon with with green circle and white checkmark" src="_images/state-ok-64.png" />
</div>
<p>The status indicator uses icons to indicate the current status of your
synchronization. The green circle with the white checkmark tells you that your
synchronization is current and you are connected to your VaultDrop server.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Status icon, icon with with blue circle and white semi-circles" src="_images/state-sync-64.png" />
</div>
<p>The blue icon with the white semi-circles means synchronization is in progress.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Status icon, icon with with yellow circle and vertical parallel lines" src="_images/state-pause-64.png" />
</div>
<p>The yellow icon with the parallel lines tells you your synchronization
has been paused. (Most likely by you.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Status icon, little gray cloud with gray circle and three horizontal white dots" src="_images/state-offline-64.png" />
</div>
<p>The gray icon with three white dots means your sync client has lost its
connection with your VaultDrop server.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Status icon, icon with with letter &quot;i&quot; in white circle" src="_images/state-information-64.png" />
</div>
<p>When you see a white circle with the letter “i” that is the informational icon,
so you should click it to see what it has to tell you.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Status icon, icon with with red circle and white x" src="_images/state-error-64.png" />
</div>
<p>The red circle with the white “x” indicates a configuration error, such as an
incorrect login or server URL.</p>
<div class="section" id="systray-icon">
<h2>Systray Icon</h2>
<p>A right-click on the systray icon opens a menu for quick access to multiple
operations.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="the right-click sync client menu" src="_images/menu.png" />
</div>
<p>This menu provides the following options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Quick access to your account</li>
<li>Sync status</li>
<li>Recent Changes, showing latest activities</li>
<li>Settings</li>
<li>Help menu</li>
<li>Pause synchronizations</li>
<li>An option to log in or log out of all of your accounts at once</li>
<li>Quit VaultDrop, logging out and closing the client</li>
</ul>
<p>A left-click on your systray icon opens the desktop client to the account
settings window.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Account settings window" src="_images/client6.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuring-VaultDrop-account-settings">
<h3>Configuring VaultDrop Account Settings</h3>
<p id="index-1">At the top of the window are tabs for each configured sync account, and three
others for Activity, General and Network settings. On your account tabs you
have the following features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Connection status, showing which VaultDrop server you are connected to, and
your VaultDrop username.</li>
<li>An <strong>Account</strong> button, which contains a dropdown menu with <strong>Log on</strong>,
<strong>Log Out</strong>, and <strong>Remove</strong>.</li>
<!--<li>Used and available space on the server.</li>-->
<li>Current synchronization status.</li>
<li><strong>Add Folder Sync Connection</strong> button, which is active only when you have
removed synchronization on an account (see <strong>Remove Sync</strong> below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The little button with three dots (the overflow menu) that sits to the right of
the sync status bar offers four additional options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Open Folder</li>
<li>Choose What to Sync (This appears only when your file tree is collapsed, and
expands the file tree)</li>
<li>Pause Sync / Resume Sync</li>
<li>Remove folder sync connection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Folder</strong> opens your local VaultDrop sync folder.</p>
<p><strong>Pause Sync</strong> pauses sync operations without making any changes to your
account. It will continue to update file and folder lists, without
downloading or updating files. To stop all sync activity use <strong>Remove
Folder Sync Connection</strong>.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">VaultDrop does not preserve the mtime (modification time) of
directories, though it does update the mtimes on files.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-manager-overlay-icons">
<h2>File Manager Overlay Icons</h2>
<p>The VaultDrop sync client provides overlay icons, in addition to the normal file
type icons, for your system file manager (Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac) to indicate the sync status of your VaultDrop files.</p>
<p>The overlay icons are similar to the systray icons introduced above. They
behave differently on files and directories according to sync status
and errors.</p>
<p>The overlay icon of an individual file indicates its current sync state. If the
file is in sync with the server version, it displays a green checkmark.</p>
<p>If the file is ignored from syncing, for example because it is on your
exclude list, or because it is a symbolic link, it displays a warning icon.</p>
<p>If there is a sync error, or the file is blacklisted, it displays an
eye-catching red X.</p>
<p>If the file is waiting to be synced, or is currently syncing, the overlay
icon displays a blue cycling icon.</p>
<p>When the client is offline, no icons are shown to reflect that the
folder is currently out of sync and no changes are synced to the server.</p>
<p>The overlay icon of a synced directory indicates the status of the files in the
directory. If there are any sync errors, the directory is marked with a warning
icon.</p>
<p>If a directory includes ignored files that are marked with warning icons
that does not change the status of the parent directories.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="activity-window">
<h2>Activity Window</h2>
<p>The Activity window contains the log of your recent activities, organized over
three tabs: <strong>Server Activities</strong>, which includes new shares and files
downloaded and deleted, <strong>Sync Protocol</strong>, which displays local activities such
as which local folders your files went into, and <strong>Not Synced</strong> shows errors
such as files not synced.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Activity windows logs all server and client activities." src="_images/client-8.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="server-notifications">
<h2>Server Notifications</h2>
<p>Starting with version 2.2.0, the client will display notifications from your
VaultDrop server that require manual interaction by you.</p>
<p>The desktop client automatically checks for available notifications
automatically on a regular basis. Notifications are displayed in the Server
Activity tab, and if you have <strong>Show Desktop Notifications</strong> enabled (General
tab) you’ll also see a systray notification.</p>
<!-- 
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Activity window with notification." src="_images/client12.png" />
</div>
<p>This also displays notifications sent to users by the VaultDrop admin via the
Announcements app.</p> -->

</div>
<div class="section" id="general-window">
<h2>General Window</h2>
<p>The General window has configuration options such as <strong>Launch on System
Startup</strong>, <strong>Use Monochrome Icons</strong>, and <strong>Show Desktop Notifications</strong>. This
is where you will find the <strong>Edit Ignored Files</strong> button, to launch the ignored
files editor, and <strong>Ask confirmation before downloading
folders larger than [folder size]</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="General window contains configuration options." src="_images/client-9.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-network-window">
<h2>Using the Network Window</h2>
<p id="index-2">The Network settings window enables you to define network proxy settings, and
also to limit download and upload bandwidth.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/settings_network.png" src="_images/settings_network.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-ignored-files-editor">
<span id="ignoredfileseditor-label"></span><h2>Using the Ignored Files Editor</h2>
<p id="index-3">You might have some local files or directories that you do not want to backup
and store on the server. To identify and exclude these files or directories, you
can use the <em>Ignored Files Editor</em> (General tab.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/ignored_files_editor.png" src="_images/ignored_files_editor.png" />
</div>
<p>For your convenience, the editor is pre-populated with a default list of
typical
ignore patterns. These patterns are contained in a system file (typically
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync-exclude.lst</span></code>) located in the VaultDrop Client application directory. You
cannot modify these pre-populated patterns directly from the editor. However,
if
necessary, you can hover over any pattern in the list to show the path and
filename associated with that pattern, locate the file, and edit the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sync-exclude.lst</span></code> file.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Modifying the global exclude definition file might render the client
unusable or result in undesired behavior.</p>
</div>
<p>Each line in the editor contains an ignore pattern string. When creating custom
patterns, in addition to being able to use normal characters to define an
ignore pattern, you can use wildcards characters for matching values.  As an
example, you can use an asterisk (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code>) to identify an arbitrary number of
characters or a question mark (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></code>) to identify a single character.</p>
<p>Patterns that end with a slash character (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/</span></code>) are applied to only directory
components of the path being checked.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Custom entries are currently not validated for syntactical
correctness by the editor, so you will not see any warnings for bad
syntax. If your synchronization does not work as you expected, check your
syntax.</p>
</div>
<p>Each pattern string in the list is preceded by a checkbox. When the check box
contains a check mark, in addition to ignoring the file or directory component
matched by the pattern, any matched files are also deemed “fleeting metadata”
and removed by the client.</p>
<p>In addition to excluding files and directories that use patterns defined in
this list:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The VaultDrop Client always excludes files containing characters that cannot
be synchronized to other file systems.</li>
<li>Files are removed that cause individual errors three times during a
synchronization. However, the client provides the option of retrying a
synchronization three additional times on files that produce errors.</li>
</ul>
